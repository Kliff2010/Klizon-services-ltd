        <h2><u>OUR EXPERIENCE</u></h2>
        <p>Klizon Services Limited boasts of one of the best track records for
            indigenous Nigerian companies engaged in the provision of integrated
            manpower support services to the oil and gas industry in Nigeria. <br>
            Our client list and the size and complexity of work undertaken has
            grown rapidly over the last few years. <br>
            We are increasingly focusing on small to medium scale operators who
            are largely uninhibited by Joint Venture Partnerships with the
            Government and other regulations and who are still in the
            development phases of their asset management lifecycle. <br>
            Our business development strategies are driven by a need to
            drastically reduce the proportion of our annual earnings that is
            based on the outcome of competitive bid processes. We also similarly
            seek to leverage strategic alliances and subcontractor relationships
            as a means of entering into new client relationships, reducing our
            direct dependence on the bid process.
